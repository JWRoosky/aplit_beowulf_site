    <span class="text" id="summary">Beowulf is an Old English relic of Scandinavian folklore in the 
        style of germanic storytelling. It tells the tale of the great hero Beowulf who travels 
        from his home of Götaland to aid the High King Hrothgar who's great new mead hall is 
        being attacked by a creature called Grendel. Beowulf arrives and kills the beast, 
        as well as it's angered mother who attacks after he kills the monster. Beowulf returns 
        to Götaland where he rules wisely as king for the remainder of his life. However as he 
        nears the end of his life, he goes out to successfully slay a dragon terrorizing his 
        kingdom, and dies shortly thereafter.
